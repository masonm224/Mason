Title of Game: Escape the Balls

The controls:    WASD for movement     R for third person view     F for first person view     Space to fire bullets    Q and C to adjust angle of camera left and right 

This is a game about avoiding the enemies coming towards you. You can shoot bullets to destroy them, but they are never ending 

This was my first ever time creating something from scratch on Unity. It was a bunch of fun. My new mechanics I wanted to include were the camera angles switches. I know they were an bonus challenge in the first unity
challenge, but I did not do it then and I only tried it now. I wanted the camera angle switch with Q and C to be more fluid, but I could not figure out how to do it. With some suggestions from friends, I made a tiny box 
in front of the player that is what shoots the bullets. That is how I was able to get around the bullet instantly destroying the player when it shot the bullet. I know the UI learning piece comes later, but I wish I could
have added it now. The assets I used are all Unity primitives. All of the textures I used, were made by me using MS paint.
